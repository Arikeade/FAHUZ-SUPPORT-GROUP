        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h2 class="female">Integrating Gender Perspectives</h2>
            <h3>Background and rationale</h3>
            <p class="policy">FAHUZ S G, since its inception has an equal opportunity system where the fundamental rights of every human being without distinction of race, religion, political belief, economic or social condition is ensured. Society prescribes to women and men different roles in different social contexts. There are also differences in the opportunities and resources available to women and men, and in their ability to make decisions and exercise their human rights. Gender roles and unequal gender relations interact with other social and economic variables, resulting in different and sometimes inequitable patterns of exposure to a number of risks, and in differential access to and utilization of health information, care and services. These differences, in turn have clear impact</p>
            <p class="policy">As a matter of policy and best practice, FAHUZ S G has inculcated gender considerations in all facets of its work. This action is also in harmony with the decision, now being implemented across the UN system., that integration of gender considerations,that is gender mainstreaming, must become standard practice in all policies and programmes. It will be the Organization's policy to ensure that all research, policies, programmes, projects, and initiatives with FAHUZ S G involvement address gender issues, as clearly demonstrated in the board of trustees. This will contribute to increasing
            the coverage, effectiveness, efficiency and ultimately the impact of its interventions for both women and men, while at the same time contributing to achievement of the broader UN goal of social justice.
            </p>
            <p class="policy">FAHUZ S G is also committed to advancing gender equality in its own workforce, as well as in scientific and technical advisory bodies, and among temporary advisers and consultants. Strategies to close the gender gap by the end of this decade fall into the broader context of diversity, and are in line with World Health Assembly Resolution WHA and the UN General Assembly. Integrating gender considerations into technical programmes and achieving equality between women and men in staffing are complementary policies.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="container">
            <h3>Goals and Objectives</h3>
            <p class="policy">The <strong>GOAL</strong> of this policy is to contribute to better programs for both women and men, through research, policies and programmes which give due attention to gender considerations and promote equity and equality between women and men. FAHUZ S G will analyse and address gender issues in planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies, programmes, projects and research in order to achieve the following</p>
            <p class="policy"> <strong>OBJECTIVES:</strong>
            Increase coverage, effectiveness and efficiency of interventions;
            Promote equity and equality between women and men, throughout the life course, and ensure that interventions do not promote inequitable gender roles relations;
            Support States and organizations on how to undertake gender-responsive planning, implementation and evaluation of policies, programmes, and projects.
            </p>
            <span class="span">Organizational arrangements for implementation</span>
            <p class="policy">Successful realization of this policy will require consistent and active participation by all staff and management. Responsibilities and actions will require collaboration and effective linkages across Departments and levels of FAHUZ S G.</p>
            <p class="policy">Management will take the necessary steps to ensure the policy is translated into action in both technical and management aspects of FAHUZ S G programmes. They will transmit the policy to technical and administrative staff and monitor its consistent and effective application throughout the work for which they are responsible.
            This policy applies to all work throughout the Organization: research, programme planning, implementation, monitoring, evaluation, human resource management, and budgeting. Effective implementation of the policy will require senior level commitment and validation, organizational support for activities to advance the knowledge and skills of staff for efficient gender analysis in their area of work.</p>

            <span class="span">Annex:</span>
            <p class="policy"><strong>Gender</strong>is used to describe those characteristics of women and men, which are socially constructed, while sex refers to those which are biologically determined. People are born female
            or male but learn to be girls and boys who grow into women and men. This learned behaviour makes up gender identity and determines gender roles.
            </p>
            <p class="policy"><strong>Gender Analysis</strong>identifies, analyses and informs action to address inequalities that arise from the different roles of women and men, or the unequal power relationships between them, and the consequences of these inequalities on their lives, their health and well-being.
            The way power is distributed in most societies means that women have less access to and control over resources and are less likely to be involved in decision making.
            Gender analysis in health often highlights how inequalities disadvantage women's health, the constraints women face to attain health and ways to address and overcome these. Gender analysis also reveals health risks and problems which men face as a result of the social construction of their roles.
            </p>
            <p class="policy"><strong>Gender Equality</strong>equality is the absence of discrimination on the basis of a person's sex in opportunities,
            in the allocation of resources and benefits or in access to services.
            </p>
            <p class="policy"><strong>Gender Equity</strong>refers to fairness and justice in the distribution of benefits and responsibilities between women and men. The concept recognizes that women and men have different needs and power and that these differences should be identified and addressed in a manner that rectifies
            the imbalance between the sexes.
            </p>
            <p class="policy"><strong>Gender Mainstreaming</strong>The ECOSOC Resolution defines mainstreaming gender as the process of assessing the implications for women and men of any planned action, including legislation, policies or programmes, in any area .and at all levels. It is a strategy for making women's as well as men's concerns and experiences an integral dimension in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies and programmes in all political, economic and social spheres, such that inequality between men and women is not perpetuated. The ultimate goal is to achieve gender equality."</p>
